# WebJetMovies
Test project to requst two API and agregate the output based on name and price

## Webjet API Test

This is a sample API provides access to a mocked movies database.

There are 2 API operations available for 2 popular movie databases, cinemaworld and filmworld

/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movies : This returns the movies that are available

/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movie/{ID}: This returns the details of a single movie

To access this API you'll require an API token.

Also just like any realworld API these may be flakey at times :)

### Exercise

Build a web app to allow customers to get the cheapest price for movies from these two providers in a timely manner.

Design a solution to have a functioning app when not all of the providers are functioning at 100 %.

The goal of the test is to allow you to present your best code that you feel proud off.

Feel free to make and document any assumptions you have made.

The API token provided to you should not be exposed to the public.
